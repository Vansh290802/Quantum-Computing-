Quantum Portfolio Optimization

Project Overview:

This repository contains the implementation of quantum algorithms for portfolio optimization in finance. The project explores the use of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to enhance portfolio optimization processes, leveraging quantum computing's potential to solve complex computational problems more efficiently than classical methods.

Features:

Quantum Algorithm Implementations: Includes implementations of QAOA and VQE specifically tailored for portfolio optimization.

Comparison with Classical Methods: Provides benchmark comparisons between quantum algorithms and traditional methods like the Markowitz portfolio theory.

Simulation Environment: Utilizes IBM's Qiskit framework for running simulations on both quantum simulators and available quantum hardware.


Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or higher
Qiskit
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
